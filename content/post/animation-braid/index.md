Thursday I'm giving a talk at the online [Toric Topology research seminar](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/research-seminar).
(I was supposed to go there in person, but you can probably expect, the current pandemic made that impossible.)
So I took the opportunity to prepare a little illustration to explain the connection between braids and configuration spaces!

This is supposed to be a video showing a braid and a path in the configuration space, but apparently your browser does not support showing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML5/WebM</a> videos.
